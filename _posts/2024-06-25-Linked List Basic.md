### Linked List 

#### What is Linked List?

Linked List is a linear data structure in which elements are not stored at a contiguous location, rather they are linked using pointers.

Linked List forms a series of connected nodes, where each node stores the data and the address of the next node.

Node Structure: A node is a linked list typically consisting of two two components:

- Data: It holds the actual value or data associated with the node.
- Next Pointer: It stores the memory address(reference) of the next node in the sequence.

Head and Tail:

- Head: The linked list is accessed through the head node, which points to the first node in the list.
- Tail: The last node in the list points to null, indicating the end of the list.

#### Types of linked list?

- Single linked list

Define: In a single linked list, each node contains a reference to the next node in the sequence. Traversing a singly linked list is done in a forward direction.

- Double linked list

Define: In a doubly linked list, each node references the next and previous nodes.

This allows for traversal in both forward and backward directions but requires additional memory for the backward reference.

- Circular linked list

Define: In a circular linked list, the last node points back to the head node, creating a circular structure. 

It can be either singly or doubly linked.

#### How is Linked List Storage in memory?

Linked List stored in memory is not continuous. It uses points to connect each node in memory.

Therefore, the nodes in a linked list are not contiguously distributed in memory but are scattered at various addresses in memory. The allocation mechanism depends on the operating system's memory management.

![062506](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Flowers2Algernon/flowers2algernon.github.io/main/assets/images/062506.png)

This linked list has a starting node with the value 2 and an ending node with the value 7. The individual nodes are distributed across memory address spaces and linked together through pointers.

#### How to define a linked list by yourself?

```java
class ListNode{
  int val;
  ListNode next;
  ListNode() {};
  ListNode(int val){this.val = val;}
  ListNode(int val, ListNode next){this.val = val;this.next = next;}
}
```

#### Linked List operation?

##### Delete nodes

To delete a node from the linked list, we need to do the following steps:

- Find the previous node of the node to be deleted.
- Change the next of the previous node.
- Free memory for the node to be deleted.

![062507](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Flowers2Algernon/flowers2algernon.github.io/main/assets/images/062507.png)

```java
//head is a linked list head nodes, cur is a temporary point used to operate linked list
ListNode cur = head;
//delete node
cur.next = cur.next.next;
```

##### Insert nodes

To insert a node after a given node in a linked list, we need to:

- Check if the given node exists or not.
  - If it does not exist, terminate the process.
  - If the given node exists:
    - Make the element to be inserted as a new node.
    - Change the next pointer of the given node to the new node.
    - Now shift the original next pointer of the given node to the next pointer of the new node.

#### Linked List compared to Array?

|             | Insert/delete (Time complexity) | Insert/delete (Time complexity) | Situation                                                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Array       | O(n)                            | O(1)                            | Data is fixed, frequent searching, infrequent insertions and deletions. |
| Linked List | O(1)                            | O(n)                            | Data is not fixed, infrequent searching, frequent insertions and deletions. |



### Remove Linked List Elements

> Given the `head` of a linked list and an integer `val`, remove all the nodes of the linked list that has `Node.val == val`, and return *the new head*.

Method 1: Directly use the original linked table for node removal operations:

![062501](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Flowers2Algernon/flowers2algernon.github.io/main/assets/images/062501.png)

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode removeElements(ListNode head, int val) {
      //need do extra operations for head nodes
        while(head!=null&&head.val==val){
            head = head.next;
        }
        if(head==null){
            return null;
        }
        ListNode cur = head;
        while(cur!=null&&cur.next!=null){
            if(cur.next.val==val){
                cur.next = cur.next.next;
            }else{
                cur = cur.next;
            }
        }
        return head;
    }
}
```

Method 2 : Setting up a virtual head node in a remove node operation:

![062502](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Flowers2Algernon/flowers2algernon.github.io/main/assets/images/062502.png)

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode removeElements(ListNode head, int val) {
        //add virtual head nodes
        ListNode newNode = new ListNode(0,head);
        ListNode cur = newNode;//cur: temporary points
        while(cur.next!=null){
            if(cur.next.val==val){
                cur.next=cur.next.next;
            }else{
                cur = cur.next;
            }
        }
        return newNode.next;  
    }
}
```

Noteï¼šThe condition in the while loop is cur.next != null, because the current position cur has already been processed.

### Reverse Linked List

> Given the `head` of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return *the reversed list*.
>
> ![062509](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Flowers2Algernon/flowers2algernon.github.io/main/assets/images/062509.jpg)

If we defined a new linked list to implement the reversal of list elements, it would actually be a waste of memory space.

In fact, we only need to change the direction of the 'next' pointers in the linked list to directly reverse it, without having to define a new linked list.

![062510](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Flowers2Algernon/flowers2algernon.github.io/main/assets/images/062510.png)

Previously, the head node of the linked list was the element 1. After the reversal, the head node is the element 5. No nodes were added or deleted; only the direction of the 'next' pointers was changed.

###### Use two pointer methods to reverse:

![062501](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Flowers2Algernon/flowers2algernon.github.io/main/assets/images/062501.gif)

- Define a `cur` pointer that points to the head node, then define a `pre` pointer and initialise it to null.
- Begin to reverse, use `tmp` pointer to store `cur.next` nodes.
- Use a loop to traverse the whole linked list.
- Finally, `cur` pointed to null, the loop is ended, and the linked list is reversed, now we just need to return `pre`

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
        //use two pointer to reverse
        ListNode tem;//used to store the node regarding to cur.next
        ListNode cur = head;
        ListNode pre = null;
        while(cur != null){
            tem = cur.next;
            cur.next = pre;
            //move next
            pre = cur;
            cur = tem;
        }
        return pre;
    }
}
```

###### Use recursion to reverse a linked list:

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
       return reverse(null,head);
    }
    
    public ListNode reverse(ListNode pre,ListNode cur){
        if(cur==null) return pre;
        ListNode tmp = cur.next;//store cur.next node
        cur.next = pre;//reverse
        // can compare it with the code for the two-pointer method. The recursive approach below essentially performs these two steps.
        //pre = cur;
        //cur = tmp;
        return reverse(cur,tmp);
    }
}
```



### Design Linked List

> Design your implementation of the linked list. You can choose to use a singly or doubly linked list.
> A node in a singly linked list should have two attributes: `val` and `next`. `val` is the value of the current node, and `next` is a pointer/reference to the next node.
> If you want to use the doubly linked list, you will need one more attribute `prev` to indicate the previous node in the linked list. Assume all nodes in the linked list are **0-indexed**.
>
> Implement the `MyLinkedList` class:
>
> - `MyLinkedList()` Initializes the `MyLinkedList` object.
> - `int get(int index)` Get the value of the `indexth` node in the linked list. If the index is invalid, return `-1`.
> - `void addAtHead(int val)` Add a node of value `val` before the first element of the linked list. After the insertion, the new node will be the first node of the linked list.
> - `void addAtTail(int val)` Append a node of value `val` as the last element of the linked list.
> - `void addAtIndex(int index, int val)` Add a node of value `val` before the `indexth` node in the linked list. If `index` equals the length of the linked list, the node will be appended to the end of the linked list. If `index` is greater than the length, the node **will not be inserted**.
> - `void deleteAtIndex(int index)` Delete the `indexth` node in the linked list, if the index is valid.

```java
class ListNode {
        int val;
        ListNode next;

        ListNode() {};

        ListNode(int val) {
            this.val = val;
        }

        ListNode(int val, ListNode next) {
            this.val = val;
            this.next = next;
        }
    }

    class MyLinkedList {
        //set virtual head nodes
        //use single linked list
        int size;//define the total nodes in linked list
        ListNode head;

        public MyLinkedList() {
            size = 0;
            head = new ListNode(0);
        }

        //be mind this index start from 0
        public int get(int index) {
            if (index < 0 || index >= size) {
                return -1;
            }
            ListNode cur = head;
            while (index >= 0) {
                cur = cur.next;
                index--;
            }
            return cur.val;
        }

        public void addAtHead(int val) {
            addAtIndex(0, val);
        }

        public void addAtTail(int val) {
            addAtIndex(size, val);
        }

        public void addAtIndex(int index, int val) {
            if (index < 0) {
                index = 0;
            }
            if (index > size) {
                return;
            }
            size++;
            ListNode cur = head;
            while (index > 0) {
                cur = cur.next;
                index--;
            }
            ListNode addNode = new ListNode(val);
            addNode.next = cur.next;
            cur.next = addNode;
        }

        public void deleteAtIndex(int index) {
            //It's necessary to check the index to avoid null pointer exceptions
            if (index < 0 || index >= size) {
                return;
            }
            size--;
            if (index == 0) {
                head = head.next;
                return;
            }
            ListNode cur = head;
            while (index > 0) {
                cur = cur.next;
                index--;
            }
            cur.next = cur.next.next;
        }
    }
```
