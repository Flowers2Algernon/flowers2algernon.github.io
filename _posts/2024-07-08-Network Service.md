### Name Resolution

#### Why do we need DNS?

##### Domain name system (DNS)

DNS is a global and highly distributed network service that resolves strings of letters into IP addresses for you.

> Let's say you wanted to check a weather website to see what the temperature is going to be like. 
>
> It's much easier to type www.weather.com into a web browser than it is to remember that one of the IP addresses for this site is 184.29.131.121. 

###### Domain name

A domain name is the term we use for something that can be resolved by DNS.

Not only does DNS make it easier for humans to remember how to get to a website, it also lets administrative changes happen behind the scenes without an end-user having to change their behaviour.
