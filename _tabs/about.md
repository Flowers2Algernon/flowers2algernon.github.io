Hey, I'm Jin.

I'm a software engineer and full-stack developer based in Perth, WA. I enjoy building things for the web, working with technologies ranging from Java and Spring on the backend to JavaScript and React on the frontend.

This blog, "Progress and Service", is where I explore technical topics and share what I've learned.

When I'm not coding, I love riding and trying new things.

Thanks for stopping by!
